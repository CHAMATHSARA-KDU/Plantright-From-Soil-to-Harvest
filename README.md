🧩 Objective

To predict the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil nutrients and climatic conditions using the Crop Recommendation Dataset from ICAR & ICFA.

🧠 Techniques Used

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, standardization, and normalization

Classification Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Visualization Tools: ggplot2 (Error Rate vs. K, Confusion Matrix plots)

📈 Key Findings

Achieved 96% classification accuracy

Optimal K value: 5

High reliability in predicting crops suitable for specific soil and weather conditions

Demonstrated real-world benefits for precision agriculture, resource optimization, and sustainability

🌍 Impact

Supports evidence-based farming

Improves resource allocation (fertilizer, water)

Promotes sustainable agricultural decision-making
